* My personal notes for swiss-army-knife-hs
  These are my personal notes for this
  project. They are not promised to be
  uptodate or even accurate. They are only
  intended for myself and no one else.

  You may find something useful here, but it is not gauranteed.
** Nothing to see here. Move it along. 
** Just ported this from the Elixir version. Elixir is not good for
   command-line utilities. It is great for writing daemons, however,
   with its all-mighty OTP.
** I need to set this up in the AUR.
** Will compile with GHC2021, but not GHC2024
   I will address this problem later, but is not a show-stopper.
** Release instructions for the AUR
   + update the version and release numbers in both:
     + PKGBUILD
     + .SRCINFO
     + as well as in the cabal file
   +
